Following assumptions are considered in modelling relationships:

1. I assume that a owner always sends all their dogs for a stay as opposed to only some of their dogs

2. A dog could belong to multiple owners, but we only consider that a dog belongs to a single owner

3. AddSitter method initializes a Sitter in our database and requires these parameters - sitter, sitter_image, sitter_phone_number,sitter_email

4. Response Time of Sitter is taken as -1 while a new Stay object is beign created

5. Assuming you're always creating unique stays and not checking if stay already exists in the database

6. Validation classes are defined in validations folder but not implemented when data is being created/updated in Models. Validation for phone number checks if number belongs only to the US.

7. Dog class has been defined but dog objects not initialized during database creation
