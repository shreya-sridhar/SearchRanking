Following assumptions are considered in modelling relationships:

1. I assume that a owner always sends all their dogs for a stay as opposed to only some of their dogs

{some validation}

2. A dog could belong to multiple owners, but we only consider that a dog belongs to a single owner

3. AddSitter method initializes a Sitter in our database and requires these parameters - sitter, sitter_image, sitter_phone_number,sitter_email

4. Response Time of Sitter is taken as -1 while a new Stay object is beign created
